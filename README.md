# Python Music Transposer
A simple music transposer that lets you transpose notes between concert C, B♭, E♭ and F instruments. 

Each note is typed into the left field, with a space between notes. A lowercase b can be used in place of the '♭' symbol, while obviously a "#" will count for a sharp. 

The default is that the input is assumed to be concert C, and whatever you pick is on the right as the output. To invert it, just check the checkbox and it will convert from the instrument of your choice to C instead. 

Hit the transpose button or press enter to transpose notes. Press the button below that to save the output notes into a text file.

Change octaves by either typing a carat ("^") to denote a higher octave or a lowercase V ("v") to denote a lower octave. 
Example Input:
"A#^" is a high A sharp. You can also type it as "A^#".
"Bbv" is a low B flat. You can also type it as "Bvb". 

If I'm not mistaken, the range of notes goes from F3 to D6.
